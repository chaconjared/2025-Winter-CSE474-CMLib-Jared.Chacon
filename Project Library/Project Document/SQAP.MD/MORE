# Purpose & Scope
The Purpose of this Software Quality Assurance Plan (SQAP) is to define the Standards, procedures, and methodologies that will used at Articles Inspect Plus (Ai+) to ensure proper First Article Inspection reports that meet with ISO and FAA requirements and will meet customer expectations.
The vision is to elevate how entertainment is consumed by integrating music as a central factor in media discovery, creating a unique and immersive experience akin to the synesthetic moment in Ratatouille where flavor combinations produce visual bursts of color. Some of the risks include: that the AI will give accurate results based on how the user interacts with the model, the UX/UI design is usable for the user, and that the API calls are available for the data necessary. With risks in mind, the team and can work to mitigate these risks through planning to address these problems.  
The use of this plan will help correctly create the following: (1) step-by-step guidance in documenting a First Article report. (2) 
# Definitions and Acronyms
| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| FAIR  | First Article Inspection Report (FAI) is a production validation process for verifying that a new or modified production process produces conforming parts that meet the manufacturing specification detailed in technical or engineering drawings. Typically, a supplier performs the FAI and the purchaser reviews the report. The FAI process usually consists of fully testing and inspecting either the first part produced by the new process or a sample from the first batch of parts. First article inspection is typically a purchase order requirement of the purchaser for the supplier to complete. If the manufacturer doesn't have the in-house capability or if the purchaser requests, the first article inspection may be conducted by an approved subcontract supplier such as a dimensional inspection/metrology laboratory. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_article_inspection
